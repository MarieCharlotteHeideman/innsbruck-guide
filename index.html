    <h3>Innsbruck, the “Bridge over the Inn”</h3>
    <p>
      is the capital of Austria’s Tirol and home to one of Europe’s most
      delightful historic old town centres. Surrounded by the craggy peaks of
      the Austrian Alps, it scores both as an Alpine playground and as a
      showcase for Habsburg Empire heritage. Innsbruck’s most famous landmark is
      a roof. But not just any roof. The Goldenes Dachl, the “little golden
      roof”, is adorned with 2,657 fire-gilt copper tiles that glimmer in the
      sun and reflect the glory days of Emperor Maximilian I, who made Innsbruck
      his imperial capital 500 years ago. “Insprucke”, the historic name of the
      town is derived from the original meaning “Bridge over the Inn”. Coveted
      by empires and dynasties throughout its history, Innsbruck is a living
      treasure house of history and culture. Architectural gems like the
      splendid Imperial Palace lurk around every corner of the old town. Its
      worthwhile Giant’s Hall and Baroque Cellar give visitors a palpable sense
      of the elegance and wealth of the former Habsburg Dynasty. Nearby Court
      Church, also called “Schwarzmanderkirche“ (literally “Black Men Church”),
      houses the empty tomb of Emperor Maximilian I and the City Tower provides
      sweeping views of the old town and – you guessed it – of the Golden Roof.
      Lively Maria-Theresien-Straße is the main pedestrianised artery of
      Innsbruck. Architecturally, expect a mix of the past and present. Historic
      façades live harmoniously with the subtle concrete façade of Kaufhaus
      Tyrol retail complex, which was designed by British architect David
      Chipperfield.
