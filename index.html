          <h2 id="about-innsbruck">Innsbruck, the “Bridge over the Inn”</h2>
          <p>
            is the capital of Austria’s Tirol and home to one of Europe’s most
            delightful historic old town centres. Surrounded by the craggy peaks
            of the Austrian Alps, it scores both as an Alpine playground and as
            a showcase for Habsburg Empire heritage. Innsbruck’s most famous
            landmark is a roof. But not just any roof. The Goldenes Dachl, the
            “little golden roof”, is adorned with 2,657 fire-gilt copper tiles
            that glimmer in the sun and reflect the glory days of Emperor
            Maximilian I, who made Innsbruck his imperial capital 500 years ago.
            “Insprucke”, the historic name of the town is derived from the
            original meaning “Bridge over the Inn”. Coveted by empires and
            dynasties throughout its history, Innsbruck is a living treasure
            house of history and culture. Architectural gems like the splendid
            Imperial Palace lurk around every corner of the old town. Its
            worthwhile Giant’s Hall and Baroque Cellar give visitors a palpable
            sense of the elegance and wealth of the former Habsburg Dynasty.
            Nearby Court Church, also called “Schwarzmanderkirche“ (literally
            “Black Men Church”), houses the empty tomb of Emperor Maximilian I
            and the City Tower provides sweeping views of the old town and – you
            guessed it – of the Golden Roof. Lively Maria-Theresien-Straße is
            the main pedestrianised artery of Innsbruck. Architecturally, expect
            a mix of the past and present. Historic façades live harmoniously
            with the subtle concrete façade of Kaufhaus Tyrol retail complex,
            which was designed by British architect David Chipperfield.

                <strong>What I like about it: </strong>This café has a great
                view on the market square, the river the Inn and the mountains.
                They have all the drinks you can wish for and they have a

                <strong>What I like about it: </strong>This fusion restaurant is
                perfectly situated in the old city centre. They have a super
                tasy menu, with bapao, poké bowl and much more. They also have

                itself! It is very cozy, almost like a living room. On the back
